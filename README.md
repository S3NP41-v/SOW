<b>a shell over discord,</b><br>
<i>the name is actually "Shell Over Wumpus" as a joke (wumpus being the name of Discord's mascot)</i>

Idea of this project is to enable people to safely establish a remote connection from outside the network with a host machine, even on public servers<br>
without the need of a static IP using discords bot API and time based, one-time use tokens

to be honest I don't use GitHub much, and I am still confused by it,
this is meant to be a project that will allow you to have a secure remote shell using Discord's bot API

ignore this: "I am sorry that I forgot my laptop that time, hopefully this message is read on it right now"
